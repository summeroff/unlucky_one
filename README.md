### Brief Overview:
Ivan, born on the forsaken outskirts of the universe in the village of Krayukha, is a walking disaster. From a meteor crashing through his family’s barn at birth to a lifetime of mishaps, his chronic bad luck defines him. When a waterlogged map reveals a path to the "Treasure of Golden Light"—a fabled artifact promising to rewrite fate—Ivan seizes the chance to escape his cursed existence. Joining the crew of the ramshackle spaceship *Old Fox*, he stumbles through cosmic perils: a near-fatal asteroid collapse, pirate ambushes, and the treacherous Temple of Zariya. Each step forward costs him dearly—friends, humanity, and pieces of his soul—until he must confront whether the treasure’s power is worth the void it leaves behind.
