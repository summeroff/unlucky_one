### Brief Overview:
Ivan, born in the bleak village of Krayukha on the universe’s edge, is cursed with perpetual bad luck. A meteor obliterates his family’s barn at birth, setting the tone for a life of mishaps. When a waterlogged map reveals the path to the "Treasure of Golden Light"—an artifact rumored to reshape fate—Ivan sets off aboard the rickety *Old Fox*. His journey spans asteroid collapses, pirate ambushes, and the perilous Temple of Zariya, where each victory exacts a toll: friends, humanity, and fragments of his soul. The tale culminates in a stark choice—claim the treasure’s power or surrender to the void it demands.
